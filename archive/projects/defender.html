            <p class="px-5 mb-5">Defender is an arcade game developed for iOS devices. The objective of the game is to defend oneself from various types of incoming attackers, utilizing a tap-to-shoot turret. The player can gain temporary "power-ups," and can upgrade their turret as they move into more advanced and difficult waves or levels. Players can choose between an endless wave mode, in which they attempt to survive as long as possible, or a can go through an array pre-made levels which increase in difficulty.
            <h4 class="px-5"><b>Technologies Used:</b></h4>
            <p class="px-5 mb-5">Defender was developed in Xcode and written in Swift and SwiftUI. To handle the necessary physics aspects of the game, Apple's SpriteKit framework was used. As such, some UIKit was also used, since SpriteKit was primarily written to to be used in applications using UIKit as opposed to SwiftUI.</p>
